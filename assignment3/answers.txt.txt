Before thread safe - 
	Program would keep printing the same things, mostly that there's no flowers.  Had some seg faults while running, if I reduced the number of needed flowers it seemed to reduce the chance of seg fault.

Thread safe program -
	After making the program thread safe, the program ran with no problems. The hives would say "no flowers" only once until they got a flower.
