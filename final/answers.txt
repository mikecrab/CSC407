1. 
Using snprintf instead of sprintf or strncpy instead of strcpy is much more secure.  snprintf and strncpy require max buffer size of the buffer.  
This makes it so people with malicious intent can't overflow the buffer to change memory that could potentially let the hacker to inject and run their own code.


2.
Extern lets the compiler know that the variable is an external variable found in another file/header.  If extern wasn't specified and the variable wasn't in the file, the compiler would error.

3.
I noticed in the object files that not all, but a lot of variables are kept in registers.  This makes it much faster to access those variables compared to variables that a kept on the stack.

4.
turn is found using is .bss because it is a global variable initialized at 0.

objdump -d -j .bss decoderServer2.o

00000000000000a0 <_ZL4turn>:
